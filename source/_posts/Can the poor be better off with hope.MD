At present, the global economic growth is weak, the polarisation between the rich and the poor is intensifying, superimposed on epidemics, regional conflicts and other factors, these common global problems are in front of mankind, and the employment problems and development prospects of individuals have become less clear. Some voices believe that we may be heading for a global economic contraction.

Traditional economic statistics, such as GDP, no longer fully reflect the key elements of human life and well-being. In her new book *The Power of Hope*, University of Maryland professor Carol Graham points out that **hope, as an important indicator of happiness and predictor of future life outcomes, has long been neglected in mainstream economic research**. Graham argues that in the absence of hope, a range of social problems - whether unemployment, school dropout, inadequate public education, or unsustainable health care - become more difficult to solve, and even fall into a vicious cycle of despair and powerlessness.

Hope is not "chicken soup". Through in-depth research and empirical analyses of poor communities in Peru and the United States, as well as in-depth studies of many successful local practices that have helped restore hope, the authors have found that even if a person is living in poverty, if he or she still harbours the hope of pursuing a higher level of education and work and works tirelessly towards this goal, he or she can still achieve good personal development at the end of the day. Through reading this book, readers will gain a systematic understanding of hope as a key predictor of well-being and a deeper understanding of the economics of well-being.

### I. Hope: a key concept in the "economics of well-being"

A sense of despair pervades our society today and has been fuelled by the Xinguang epidemic. For individuals, the degree of despair is a matter of their physical and mental health and future development. If a society loses hope, not only will it be unable to solve the current social problems such as unemployment, economic weakness, and political polarisation, but the despair will also be passed on to the next generation, who will no longer be able to invest in their future and adapt to the changing job market. Therefore, how to restore hope becomes the core reality of the author's book.

Hope is a factor that has long been underappreciated in current economic research. However, the authors argue that hope is not only a key indicator in happiness research, but also has an important place in the study of the 'economics of well-being'.

The author's longstanding interest in the economics of well-being stems from his experiences growing up in the United States and Peru. Travelling between the two countries, the author has noticed something very puzzling: **While the United States, one of the richest countries in the world, has a pervasive atmosphere of despair in its society, the poor in Peru show considerable hope and resilience, even in the face of hyperinflation and the threat of terrorism**. 

This contrast implies that public policy should be examined not only in terms of statistical indicators of economic growth, but also in terms of its effectiveness in enhancing social well-being, which is what makes the study of "well-being economics" so special. The author chose to use hope as a measure of well-being because he had already concluded from previous research that, among a range of factors related to well-being, **groups with different levels of wealth had the most pronounced differences in their levels of hope for the future**.

Although the incorporation of hope into actual policymaking or scientific research remains limited, some government agencies have begun to incorporate well-being metrics into public policymaking, while some foundations have begun to invest in research on hope or in projects aimed at restoring hope. In this book, the authors seek to demonstrate empirically that the impact of hope on individual future achievement and social development is so significant that it needs to be incorporated into conventional statistical analyses and academic research in economics.

Specifically for this book, the authors first distinguish between hope and optimism. Hope contains the psychology of optimism, but has a more practical meaning than optimism: when a person is hopeful, it means that he can do something to improve his life, thus showing his future-oriented ability (agency). Therefore, if hope is defined in terms of agency, it is no longer "in the air". In order to facilitate the measurement, the authors associate hope with specific aspirations, and measure hope in three dimensions: educational aspirations (the level of education an individual wishes to achieve), occupational aspirations (the level of occupation an individual wishes to pursue), and migratory aspirations.

In order to remove the influence of confounding factors on individuals' future outcomes, the authors controlled for a range of variables such as personality traits and socioeconomic status in their study. The authors argue that for the more affluent, their own traits and status may be sufficient to enable them to achieve good personal development, whereas for the poor, who do not have the relevant traits and status advantages, it is more important and relevant whether they actually show hope and whether hope has a potential impact on their future outcomes.

Trends in individual aspirations over time


The authors conducted two rounds of follow-up surveys in a poor urban fringe community located in Peru, and the analysis of the surveys shows that:

First, **relatively poor individuals can also set very high levels of aspirations** for themselves; for example, even when born in poor neighbourhoods, as many as 41 per cent of respondents want to study at postgraduate level in terms of educational aspirations, 47 per cent aim for undergraduate degrees, 10 per cent want technical education, and as many as 93 per cent of respondents say they want to relocate in terms of migratory aspirations;

Second, **these individuals can maintain their dedication to specific aspirations over time**, and comparing the results of the two rounds of survey, about half of the respondents were able to maintain their aspiration levels (as shown in the chart above);

Third, if the aspirations that these individuals set for themselves are realistic, then **the higher their level of aspiration, the better their future personal development outcomes**, as evidenced in particular by substantial improvements in educational attainment and employment quality.

The authors further investigated low-income black and white neighbourhoods within St. Louis County, Missouri, USA, using a similar questionnaire. The findings were similar. The majority of white respondents at the same economic level had lost hope for the future and indicated that they pursued their aspirations but lacked parental support; however, most of the low-income African-American respondents showed the same hope for the future as the poor Peruvians, especially focusing on the long-term pursuit of higher educational levels.

### II. How can hope be rebuilt?

Through empirical analyses, the authors demonstrate that **most poor people actually set high aspirations for themselves, and that higher levels of these aspirations tend to be associated with better personal development outcomes**. However, under the impact of the New Crown Epidemic, the weak economic development of countries, the widening gap between the rich and the poor, and the intensifying conflicts among different groups, more and more people have lost their hope, just as the white poor did above. Can hope be rebuilt for those who have lost it for various reasons?

The authors list a range of replicable interventions and policy measures that require the involvement of the community, schools, government and others. For example, the community can provide a variety of mental health treatment and support programmes to alleviate feelings of unhappiness, despair or loneliness; communities and schools can set up mentorship programs to support young people in achieving their educational aspirations, create inter-school virtual classrooms, share best practice in teaching and learning, and promote high school partnerships with local colleges and businesses to encourage high school students to access tertiary courses and job placement. The private sector can work with colleges and communities in disadvantaged areas to provide long-term training and internships.

**For these measures to be successful, they need to be rooted in the community**. Communities should embrace lonely and desperate individuals who find it difficult to rejoin the labour market, and encourage them to participate in community activities to help them regain confidence, motivation and trust in others through a series of volunteer services, artistic practices and group outdoor activities. In addition, in the context of industrial upgrading, as old job skills are giving way to new ones, the community should train young people in cutting-edge technologies and services, so that they can seize the opportunities available to them and better adapt to the labour market of the future.
